# My Zynq FreeRTOS Sandbox
This is my sandbox for experimenting with the features offered by the AMD (Xilinx) FreeRTOS port. The main platform used is the Digilent Zybo-z7-20. The implemented system is quite simple, comprising a range of GPIO features (LEDs, buttons, switches, and test outputs for monitoring) and two UART communication channels. The IDE is Vitis 2023.2 (Classic version). More details on the system can be found here (TBD). A list of projects is as follows:

- Semaphore Project 1: UART command Handler
- Queue Project 1: UART Command Handler
- Semaphore/Queue Project 2: HW Tick Timers and UART Command Handler
- Notifer Project 1: UART Comms Done Notifier System
